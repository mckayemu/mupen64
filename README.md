# mupen64

A nintendo ultra64 emulator for venenux under older machines and low end performace computers.

**This its only for able to use the emulator on older hardware, not for made support on it!**

old emulator for older machines, due mupen64plus does'n compile in older machines, if when compile, runs slow
